the opertaing system is in charge of calling the main method
source code --  compiler-- executable(i.e a.out)

once an executable has been generated, there is no need to recompile. You can rerun.

preprocessor is like a library, #include, using namespace, etc
including files are called header files
we can make our own include files

:: scope operator

Object files conatins:
- executable code
- gloabl variables
- constants
- linkage information

<< insertion
>> extraction

cout<<
cin>>

without io stream, cin and cout are undefined

STRINGS-----------

a string is an array of chars

can use .append to concatenate
comparison operators: ==, !=. <.>,<= and >=
strings can also be indexed

s2.at(index) return a char at that index.
can also use .substr to get substring of string

s1.find(s2) searches for the first occurene of a particular substring
